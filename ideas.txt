ideas:

- grab live data from EcoCounter counting machines via https://github.com/derhuerst/eco-counter-client
- interactive visualization of statistical model
- compute ratio of space needed by bikes vs cars and the actual numbers of bikes/cars passing by
- impute missing weather observations (assuming simiar weather as e.g. 30 minutes earlier)
- add model benchmarking (e.g. RMSE score, based on cross-validation)
